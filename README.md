[In this project we will be working on the kaggle competition.](https://www.kaggle.com/c/msk-redefining-cancer-treatment "https://www.kaggle.com/c/msk-redefining-cancer-treatment")

This product is for cancer researchers who need to classify large numbers of genetic mutations using scientific journal articles.

Basically this project is to process a text file written in English, and extract some feature from the infomation given and classify the gene into the most possible class. We are using doc2vec and keras to built the model and this model doesn't really detect cancer.

The mian web page can be accessed in Webpage-final-version folder, and the code for upload file web is in webapp_aws folder.

The algorithm can be accessed in Modeling folder.

We have ran an automated test on Monkey Test, the test results can be found on https://monkeytest.it/test/379f676f-45ce-49fd-8c11-fb14c375b645
